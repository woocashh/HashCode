Submission of our first participation in the Google HashCode competiton. Despite the novelty of this challenge, our team managed to be the second in the year (1st Computing at Imperial College) and one of the top at the University. "Nerdy Bulls" scored roughly 26 000 000 points, where the World's top was 27 200 000. (1359 out of 10000 teams).
